# CPU
We were tasked with creating a functioning central processing unit (CPU) completely from scratch, 
using the hardware description language (HDL): Verilog. This task includes creation and 
implementation of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with corresponding general purpose, program 
segment, pointer, status, and increment registers. The components interact via instructions 
from the control unit and are stored in a bank of internal memory.

To approach this task, we sought to capitalize on the individual strengths of each contributor 
while closely collaborating. One who felt comfortable tackling the ALU mainly focused on the 
intricate mathematical operations of the unit, while another chose to dive into the control unit 
and its corresponding registers through brute force. Both parties received support from the other 
collaborators providing other necessary registers and testbenches for each component. We met regularly 
to discuss the status of the project, including troubleshooting issues and celebrating successes.
